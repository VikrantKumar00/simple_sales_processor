Simple Sales Data Processor
A beginner-friendly Python project demonstrating basic data processing steps: data ingestion, transformation, and loading to a file.

🚀 Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to:

Read a set of raw sales records.

Calculate the total_revenue for each sales record.

Save the processed data (including the total_revenue) to a new text file.

Calculate and display aggregate metrics (total and average revenue).

This project serves as a foundational example for understanding simple data pipeline concepts using Python.

✨ Features
Data Ingestion (Simulated): Raw sales data is defined directly within the Python script.

Data Transformation: Calculates total_revenue by multiplying quantity and unit_price.

Data Loading: Outputs the processed data to processed_sales_output.txt in a comma-separated format.

Aggregate Metrics: Calculates the total and average revenue across all sales.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

🏃 How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/VikrantKumar00/simple_sales_processor.git


Navigate into the project directory:

cd simple_sales_processor

Run the Python script:

python process_sales.py

This will execute the script, print output to your console, and create/update the processed_sales_output.txt file in the same directory.

📈 Example Output (processed_sales_output.txt)
Product,Quantity,UnitPrice,TotalRevenue
Laptop,1,1200.0,1200.0
Mouse,2,25.0,50.0
Keyboard,1,75.0,75.0
Monitor,1,300.0,300.0
Webcam,3,50.0,150.0

💡 Future Enhancements
Read data from a CSV file instead of hardcoded data.

Write processed data to a CSV file or a simple SQLite database.

Add more complex data transformations (e.g., categorizing products).

Implement basic error logging.
